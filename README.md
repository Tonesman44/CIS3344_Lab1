In this lab we got a simple understanding of Git and Github. After we downloaded git onto our machines and learned how to make a repo. Then we cloned the professors repo which contained a read me and index.html file. We then made changes to the file because it had mistakes. Here are the list of mistakes I found:
- Commit 1: Body was before head and after html
- Commit 2: Link tag contained the text within the start of the tag. Needed a > symbol
- Commit 3: Did not say doctype
- Commit 4: list closing tag was missing on traveling
