# Lab 1 

In this lab we got a simple understanding of Git and Github. After we downloaded git onto our machines and learned how to make a repo. Then we cloned the professors repo which contained a read me and index.html file. We then made changes to the file because it had mistakes.

## List of Fixes  
1. **Commit 1**  
   - **Issue:** The `<body>` tag was placed before `<head>` and after the `<html>` tag.  
   - **Fix:** Rearranged the tags to follow the proper HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, then `<body>`).  

2. **Commit 2**  
   - **Issue:** A `<link>` tag contained text within the tag instead of properly closing it.  
   - **Fix:** Added the missing `>` symbol to close the `<link>` tag.  

3. **Commit 3**  
   - **Issue:** The document was missing the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.  
   - **Fix:** Added `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top of the file.  

4. **Commit 4**  
   - **Issue:** A closing `</li>` tag was missing for the "Traveling" list item.  
   - **Fix:** Added the missing `</li>` tag to properly close the list item.
